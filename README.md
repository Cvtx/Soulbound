# Soulbound

Soulbound is a third-person hack and slash game set in fantasy feudal Japan. Game features combo-based combat system, magical abilities, weapon switching and more. 
Main inspiration was taken from games such as Sekiro and Devil May Cry.

See the demo at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g5XbE5VgKc).

This project was started a year ago as my student work. The game is still at an early stage of development and needs to be polished.

At the moment, no license is offered.
